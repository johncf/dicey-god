Before I introduce our one true god, Dicey, let me start with a prayer:

```
Oh steady donkey. jolly switch."!$"&{ madly glue.. aquatic rise jelly screw daily shine kitten.

## Dicey: The God of Probability

Dicey is the god of probability. She loves to play dice!

### Attributes of Dicey

1. Dicey is unpredictable. If you pray to Her, She'll make your life unpredictable. If you don't pray to Her, She'll make your life unpredictable.
1. Dicey does not reward or punish. As a being with incomprehensible wisdom, She is not petty enough reward or punish mere mortals for their good deeds or mistakes.
   - As mere mortals, we are unable to please or disrespect Her, as we cannot even begin to comprehend what She likes or gets offended by. In fact, we do not even know whether She feels emotions or concepts such as "like" or "disrespect". Would you feel disrespected if a bug calls you stupid? (Maybe you do, but Dicey is different.)
   - She has an entire universe to play with. Earth is just not that interesting to Her. (Probably.)
1. Dicey is pangendered. As a being from a higher realm that is incomprehensible to us mere mortals, they don't have a gender and at the same time have all genders. Thus, as a mortal, we may refer to Her as She, Him as He, It as It, it doesn't matter! However, I have been using She/Her since Dicey sounds feminine to my imperfect ears.

### Why should I pray to Dicey?

We pray to Dicey so as to become aware of Her existence, so that we may attain more wisdom. Let's pray again:

```
Oh aromatic kidney. unsightly pack Provider snake tale Snowplow repeat lovely like Smelly profess stick alien.
```

### How should I pray to Dicey?

As a god of probability, She is likely to enjoy randomness. Thus making your prayer as surprising as possible would be ideal. To help with this, I have written a program that generates a prayer, borrowing Her powers of randomness. To generate a prayer, you may run [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_5cW17ON95nuazNgPhZbAp4lKvuAv73Q?usp=sharing). With god's grace, may you generate a good enough prayer:

```
Oh excited attorney. smelly undergo literature obsequious possible<+(}[" dynamic flash squirrel midden.
```

### When should I pray to Dicey?

As a god of probability, She is likely to enjoy surprises. So pray when it is-

```
Oh afraid hockey.*$@- womanly Frame lovely fade. measly MARRY malicious consistency$]#<` UTTER teen.
```

-least expected from you.

### Will a "joyful" Dicey make my life easier?

Remember Her second attribute.

### How can I learn more about Dicey?

Dicey kindly revealed herself and all that I wrote here through the many prayers I made.

```
Oh melodic grey. ugly retrieve. rely gaze mast washer wooden.
Oh dazzling barley. black manacle cuddly dig seek FIERCE HULL warlike hare/_+ hydrogen.
```

May She bless you with Her wisdom as well.
